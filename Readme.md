# Advent of Code, 2015

This is a repository to store my workings for [AoC
2015](http://adventofcode.com/). It's written in a very stripped down
version of C++. It could be easily converted to straight C without
much trouble if needed.

I'm slowly plodding through it for fun. I'm also working on some of my
secondary coding skills, such as editting and cleanup, as I go
through. I'm trying to be reasonably efficient, but I haven't gone to
great lengths to do so. I also get distracted by side-quests on occasion.
